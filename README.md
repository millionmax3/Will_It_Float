Will It Float Simulator

This simulator aims to determine if an object will float in a fluid. The user has the ability to select an object from a dropdown list and enter a mass and dimensions. The user can then select a fluid to place the object in from a dropdown list. The simulation will then run some calculations to determine the result!
